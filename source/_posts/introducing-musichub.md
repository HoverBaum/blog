[MusicHub](http://musichub.xn--der-grne-baum-1ob.net/)Â is a website I have been working on lately.

I started it after joining [DiscussionHub](http://discussionhub.net/member.php?action=register&amp;referrer=543), a friendly general discussion forum. I wanted to make something for all members and so I came up with the concept for MusicHub. The idea is to have an easy to use and minimalistic music player on the web. A website you can visit and listen to some good music.

Staying true to this concept music starts playing once you visit the site. You can skip songs, play/pause, choose to jump to a specific song from the playlist and change the volume. You can also change the background image, but that is more of an on top feature.

I hope you enjoy the site.

I learned some things building it, most notably how to work with audio on a website. There will be a post about that, so stay tuned.
