After my recent undertaking to migrate a blog from Wordpress to Contentful I was also faced with the challenge to import content to a Space that had a different locale than the Space it was exported from. This came about after we setup a "base" space for our Product that is supposed to be rolled out in multiple countries.

Once again I wanted to use the [Contentful-import] tool to get this job done. However soon I kept seeing:

```
‚úñ Checking if destination space already has any content and retrieving it
   ‚Üí       Default locale for destination space: es-ES
```

<!--more-->

And while [Contentful-bootstrap](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-bootstrap.rb) supports a `--locale` flag to do this it is a now unsupported Ruby based tool. As a webdeveloper I obviously want to use a Node based tool like Contentful-import.

It the solution is quite easy, we simply need to replace each occurrence of the tarting locale with the desired one. Using a regular expression on the JSON representation of our exported space makes this a breeze.

```javascript
const desiredLocale = 'es-ES'
const replacesLocaleCodes = space.replace(/en-US/g, desiredLocale)
```

Super simple really. After running our exported Space through this we can run our import with it and succeed üéâ

## Gotchas

However we will now find that our Space has a default locale called "English" that is the Spanish language üòï

To change that we need to replace the locale object in the `.locale` attribute of our exported space with the correct one for our target space. Assuming we have an array of locales exported from Contentful we can achieve this quite easily.

```javascript
const targetLocale = 'es-ES'

// Assuming array locales with locale objects exported from Contentful.
if (!locales.find(locale => locale.code === targetLocale)) {
  console.log(`Sorry, but we don't support ${targetLocale}`)
}

// Again assuming you have a way to get your space.
const space = await getExportedSpace()
const replacesLocaleCodes = space.replace(/en-US/g, targetLocale)
const parsedSpace = JSON.parse(replacesLocaleCodes)
parsedSpace.locales = [locales.find(locale => locale.code === targetLocale)]
console.log(JSON.stringify(parsedSpace, null, 2))
```

## Creating a util

Because this is bothersome and I am probably not the only one facing this problem you can find [my solution on Github](https://github.com/HoverBaum/contentful-locale) and [install it via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hoverbaum/contentful-locale) üßô‚Äç

```bash
npm install -g @hoverbaum/contentful-locale

contentful-locale exportedSpace.json target-locale -s output.json
```

You can also find [the original code as a Gist](https://gist.github.com/HoverBaum/cd1058d4fde2dffcb0d127c506b52a3e).
