One important topic for myself is language.

You will soon notice that my blog will be mostly English and sometime German. At least that is what I think will happen.

&nbsp;

**But how come?**

Well a lot of times I think in English. Sometime because I am reading in English and think about it, sometimes because it helps to see a bigger picture if you think in "not your native language" and sometime just because I feel like it. Adding unto that some content of this blog will be a different version of something I release on English speaking forums or generally tutorials about tech related things. For these topics I find English to be more appropriate, as it finds a bigger audience and other related documents are usually English.

Sometimes however things will be in German. When I happen to experience something culture related, or talk about holidays. Things like that will be in German.

There will be tags for the language used in a post so just use those if you only want one language.
