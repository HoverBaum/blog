As a developer I obviously have to use GitHubs [gists](https://gist.github.com/HoverBaum). So how about an organized index of my two cents on things.

## JS Development

One of my biggest hobbies, as well as my current internship. So there is a lot I have learned and don't want to forget. These are practical tutorials on how to do things and get set up.

- [Setup a development environment for JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/HoverBaum/021cec80d0a095153a439f89fd33695f)  
- [Test Javascript](https://gist.github.com/HoverBaum/d9e7588c0cb5d704e966c780992c9c5b)
- [Document Javascript](https://gist.github.com/HoverBaum/bda5f85e03410d7bad758dd697e3f795)  

## Hobbies and the like

- [Public domain images](https://gist.github.com/HoverBaum/d8183e4d5f1a8222c7a1ec516298847c)  
Something you can always use are images that are free (as in free beer) to use.  
Technically there is a problem with using CC0 images in Germany, as a copyright holder can not give up his right to be named.

- [Pen & Paper](https://gist.github.com/HoverBaum/12d8b414d577fbf77c17d38c27cb0f28)  
Motivation fuer Pen & Paper, Dinge die Lust darauf machen wieder eine Runde zu spielen.
(yes this is German)
