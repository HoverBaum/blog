Recently I enjoyed my first ever Tech Conference, here in Hamburg and today I will share my experiences, insights and learnings. Because, as with every thing that you do for the first time, I was super excited, the event was super fun and I learned so much, not only form the talks but also about visiting Tech Conferences.

Follow me along memory lane and how I got to be at the conference, what I experiences there and which lessons I learned.

## An amazing opportunity

Since what feels like forever I have enjoyed watching videos from conferences. They are simply the best way to keep up with whats happening, learn about framework and find inspiration. A wish to visit such conferences only slowly started to grow within me. But soon a small seed of curiosity was blooming into a bright flower, demanding attention. I am also aiming to one day become a speaker at such conference, as giving talks is simply super fun to me. Thus, when a colleague had two tickets for a local conference to give away, I immediately jumped at the occasion!

> Most Conference Visitors don't personally pay for their ticket.

As it turned out, most people I met there either got their ticket paid by their company or, like me, accompanied a speaker. While companies happily pay for the event, getting time off work to go there, can be a different story. I myself experienced a bit of a strungle until I could go without expending holidays on the trip.

## Being there

Ohhh, let me tell you about it! Being at the venue was amazing. This particular conference was hosted inside a cinema. As it turns out, cinema showrooms are perfectly build to host talks. The chairs sure where comfortable. And there was free popcorn and Coke all day long, an amazing cinema experience.

The audience was a mixed bunch. There was everything from the well dressed IT-consultant or manager in shirts and jackets to the more relaxed developer wearing their favorite, nerdy T-Shirt or the conference shirt they got mailed beforehand.
