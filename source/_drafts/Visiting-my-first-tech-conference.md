Recently I enjoyed my first ever Tech Conference, here in Hamburg and today I will share my experiences, insights and learnings. Because, as with every thing that you do for the first time, I was super excited, the event was super fun and I learned so much, not only form the talks but also about visiting Tech Conferences.

Follow me along memory lane and how I got to be at the conference, what I experiences there and which lessons I learned.

## An amazing opportunity

Since what feels like forever I have enjoyed watching videos from conferences. They are simply the best way to keep up with whats happening, learn about framework and find inspiration. A wish to visit such conferences only slowly started to grow within me. But slowly a small seed of curiosity was blooming into a bright flower, demanding attention. I am also aiming to one day become a speaker at such conference, as giving talks is simply super fun to me. Thus when a colleague had two tickets for a local conference to give away, I immediately jumped at the occasion!
