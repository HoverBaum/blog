Templating languages have been a part of the web forever. We have seen languages with native templateing support (PHP) as well as domain specific templating languages (EJS). With ES6 JavaScript joined the native support crew. This new and as of yet undervalued feature is knows as "Template Literals" and today we are going to take a dive.

We are going to examine what feature Template Literals provide and how to use them for basic tasks. Building upon this understanding we will explore more advanced features to help us use Teamplate Literals as a rendering engine fro HTML templates. Finally equiped with all this knowledge we are going to write a simple application to display some data.

And let's clear up one more confusion up front. You might also have heared the term "Template String". It refers to the exact same thing as "Template Literal" and is simply an earlier name in the spec that was later changed to "Template Literal".

## Introducing Templae Literals

// Generally explain teh feature and how to use it, taking a deeper dive - already build some simple html

### Tagged Teamplate Literals

// Adding some power

## Extending Template Literals for HTML

// Examine how we can better use it for html - simplify above html using new html tag

Bonus: Many editors already recognize a `html` tag an will enable code-highlighting within the template literal.

## A basic example

// A flower shop that is a selv-contained app
